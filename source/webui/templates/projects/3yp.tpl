<h2>Third Year Project</h2>

<p>
    My third year dissertation was a research/design/build project investigating the use of RSA keys and a web-of-trust to provide
    simple and secure yet password-less and zero-configuration file sharing between users located on the same network segment. 
</p>
<p>
    The source code is currently archived on CD, but I will attempt to locate and upload a copy of the version control repository in due course.
    In the meantime, for anyone who might be interested in the rationale, design decisions and implementation detail, please see the
    <a href="{$base_uri}files/3yp/project-report.pdf" title="RSDSS Post Project Report">post-project report</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The project was not completed beyond an alpha stage, so the binaries below are strictly for testing purposes only and are definitely
    not ready for any kind of production use. These are provided as-is with no guarantees for functionality or safetly!
